<h1> Pangolin</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
    Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters,
    [5] are mammals of the order Pholidota (/fɒlɪˈdoʊtə/, from Ancient Greek ϕολιδωτός – "clad in scales").[6] The one extant family, 
    the Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus, and Smutsia. Manis comprises the four species found in Asia, while
     Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in sub-Saharan Africa.[7]
     These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are also known.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales, similar in material to fingernails and toenails, covering their skin;
     they are the only known mammals with this feature. They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species.
      Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long tongues.
       They tend to be solitary animals, meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for
        about two years.

<h2>Poaching</h2>
<p>
    Some pangolins walk with their front claws bent under the foot pad, although they use the entire foot pad on their rear limbs. Furthermore, some exhibit 
    a bipedal stance for some behaviour, and may walk a few steps bipedally.[22] Pangolins are also good swimmers.[20]
